-- Table Schema:
-- Table: npn_users
--   user_id: INT
--   user_name: VARCHAR
--
-- Table: npn_messages
--   message_id: INT
--   sender_id: INT
--   sent_at: TIMESTAMP
--

-- My Solution:

WITH daily_counts AS (
  SELECT 
    DATE(sent_at) AS times,
    sender_id,
    COUNT(message_id) AS frequency_sent
  FROM npn_messages
  GROUP BY 1,2
),
daily_rank AS (
  SELECT *,
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY times ORDER BY frequency_sent DESC) AS ranks
  FROM daily_counts
)
SELECT *, user_name
FROM daily_rank
LEFT JOIN npn_users ON npn_users.user_id = daily_rank.sender_id
WHERE ranks = 1
ORDER BY frequency_sent DESC;
