-- Table Schema:
-- Table: daily_quiz_scores
--   subject: VARCHAR
--   quiz_date: DATE
--   score: INTEGER
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT DISTINCT *
FROM (
  SELECT subject,
    FIRST_VALUE(score) OVER(
      PARTITION BY subject 
      ORDER BY quiz_date) AS first_values,
    LAST_VALUE(score) OVER(
      PARTITION BY subject 
      ORDER BY quiz_date
      ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
    ) AS last_values
  FROM daily_quiz_scores) AS improve_Scores;
